## About This Repository

This is the basic network diagramming to highlight the servers and eventually services running on each of the servers across the globe.

## About ShinobiNet

ShinobiNET is the name for the network of computers that I maintain both on-premise in my apartment in Colombia and in the cloud across (today).

As of today, the ShinobiNet network provides internet services from three different continents. #cool.
